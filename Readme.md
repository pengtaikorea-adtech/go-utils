# go-utils

golang based utility snippets for internal use

## OK, go stands for the "performance". how's yours'?

Considering golang for your project, you may put its performance at first.

Yes, go is super fast, so light-weighted that most other languages can never be comparable. ~~No, do not come up with some jewerly names. Sometimes we make bad decisions.~~ BTW, how's your performance with golang? R U lightweighted as much as golang?

No, golang doesn't support generic. Neigther it can bind dynamic types. USE go generate instead. -- At this point, I, personally, supposed that the programming language is not for typing. Instead, it's for generators. If you're really into coding, *YOU MUST TYPING GENERATORS THAN ACTUAL CODE ITSELF*. Fantastic. Toast for googlers, those indexing-everything-in-the-hello-world-freaking-super-mega-genius.

Bad news here: We, normal software engineers, are just novice. Those sophisticated hyper-physical-theoretic-art it not our style. Trust me. You're typing **int** again! No build generator instead! have struct and its interface! You can not inherit anything from other struct, but well, how's nesting? Oh.

**go-utils** is for those "about average" developers. *I know reflection drags the system performace* - sigh, But It actually helps fast coding! golang is yet light, powerful, handy with reflect. have generic for all type slices! serialize any struct with binds! YOU CAN NOT OVERCOME go AT YOUR PERFORM. admit it.

- [x] slices: javascript style slice::forEach, map, filter, reduce functions.
- [x] binds: python style instance - dictionary (de-)serialization. map it fast.
- [x] gins: handy tools for gin framework
- [x] secure: handy tools for security
- ... 

Code it fast. Upgrade *YOUR* performance. go's yet powerful anyway.
